If there is only two dimension, we can solve it by sort and Fenwick-Tree, 
with time complex O(nlogn). We can split each query into 8 cube query 
through the origin.

This problem has four dimension (x,y,z,and time), so we can use divide skill 
to solve two dimensions, and solve the other two by sort and Fenwick-Tree.

Time complex: O(nlogn^3).
