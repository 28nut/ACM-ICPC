This problem is similar to srm597-hard.
Now we have four numbers a,b,c,and d.
Consider enum g: merge a and b into g parts.This can be done in O(a+b)
using the method mentioned in srm597-hard. Then the problem is reduced
to three numnbers. Now it's actually a srm597-hard.
Time complex: O((a+b)^2).

Extend:
Using this idea, can we solve a n number problem in O(sum_{A[0~n-3]}^(n-2))?
