	Here comes the solution:
	Enumerate the start leaf and the end leaf, or the two start leaves,
then we can get a possible answer,and the set of start leaves who will not influence the answer.From the set we do a spfa function,to check if every edge is covered between the certain time.
	Time complex: O(n^3).
